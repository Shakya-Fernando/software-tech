# 2810ICT Software Technologies | Data Analysis and Visualisation

The assigned group-based project requires the completion of simple data analysis and visualisation through a graphical user interface.
The subject of this task is a hand-picked dataset; Australian NSW Traffic Penalty data 2012 â€“ 2017. The project consists of two phases: design and implementation.

The design element of this task consists of producing a project plan, which includes: a Project Overview, Work-Breakdown Structure, Activity Definition and Estimation, and a Gantt chart. The project plan will be used to define our goals and objectives by creating an overview and a work-breakdown structure, which will subsequently define our activities. A Gantt chart will be utilised for the scheduling and time estimation of tasks. A Software Design Document will be developed containing a Systems Vision Statement, a formal list of Software Requirements, Use Cases, System Components, Software Design, and an early Interface Design.

The implementation process will be determined based on the design created in the first phase. Before implementation, a testing plan will be formulated to thoroughly test various components of the system.
Upon completion of testing a report will be made to process the results alongside a user manual that will explain how to use the software and show it features.
To finish the implementation phase, an executive summary will be utilized to present the data over a 12-month period.
